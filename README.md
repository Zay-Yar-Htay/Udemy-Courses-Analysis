## Key Findings
1. Across all subjects, there is a positive correlation between the number of subscribers and the revenue generated. 2015 has the highest revenue with over $300M and subscribers with over 3M and 2011 has the lowest.
2. 2016 has the highest number of published courses with a total 1,206 courses for all levels and subjects.
3. Web development subject has the most subscribed and revenue generated subject followed by business finance subject.
4. Most subscriptions and revenue come from all level students followed by beginner level students.
5. Learn HTMLL5 programming from scratch course is the popular course as a free course with the highest number of subscribers and 3rd highest number of reviews for all level students and the web developer bootcamp is the most popular course as a paid course with the highest num of reviews and 3rd highest num of subscribers under Web Development Subject.

## Recommendation
1. Consider publishing courses for expert & intermediate levels since they have the lowest revenue and subscribers comparing to other levels during the period (2011-2017).
2. Consider publishing courses for musical instruments and graphic design subjects since they're the lowest revenue and subscribers comparing to other subjects during the period (2011-2017).
3. In order to have more subscribers, consider offering free courses in the future. Especially for expert levels and musical instruments subjects.
